# Model Testing

## Introduction

The repository contains scripts, data and instructions for testing different approaches to get invoice data for scanned invoices. The main goal is to extract relevant information from invoices such as invoice number, date, total amount, tax amount, and vendor details.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
- invoices/          # Contains sample scanned invoice images
- invoices/expected_data  # Contains expected extracted data for validation
- invoices/<flow>/results # Contains results from different extraction flows
- flows/             # Contains workflow scripts for processing invoices
-
```
